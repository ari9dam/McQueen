Separate two eggs by cracking the shells on a flat surface, gently prying the broken shells apart, letting the whites slide through your fingers into one bowl while holding the unbroken yolks in your hand, to place in another bowl. Beat the yellow egg yolks together with a whisk, and add 1 1/2 cups milk, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1 cup melted butter. Whisk. Add the wet mixture into the dry mixture and whisk again. Use a stand mixer with the whisk attachment fitted to whisk the whites until they hold firm peaks, standing straight up when you remove the whisk. Using a silicone spatula, gently fold the egg whites into the flour mixture by placing one spoonful of egg whites at a time into the bowl, lifting some of the mixture over the whites and repeating this gently until the whites are completely mixed in and the mixture is light and fluffy. Take great care not to 'crunch' the mixture, pushing out air.	1	mixture dry care time hold place fluffy bowl broken eggs powder mixture whisk beat air apart take milk completely sugar yellow holding peaks mixed 5dd46370c8f1439bb34ba5d1725d1bd0 prying remove shells firm 12 straight baking whisk fold self another letting flour one stir rising 3 spatula light placing large crunch balloon flat teaspoons tablespoons teaspoon whisk unbroken bowl cups white vanilla again together spoonful use egg pushing slide yolks separate whites extract wet using lifting attachment 34 stand bowl repeating mixer hand silicone standing melted great cracking gently fingers two cup fitted add 1 surface butter flour
To make Belgian waffles:1	5dd46370-c8f1-439b-b34b-a5d1725d1bd0	In a large bowl, stir together two cups self rising flour, 3/4 cup white sugar, and 3 3/4 teaspoons baking powder with a balloon whisk. Separate two eggs by cracking the shells on a flat surface, gently prying the broken shells apart, letting the whites slide through your fingers into one bowl while holding the unbroken yolks in your hand, to place in another bowl. Beat the yellow egg yolks together with a whisk, and add 1 1/2 cups milk, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1 cup melted butter. Whisk. Add the wet mixture into the dry mixture and whisk again. Use a stand mixer with the whisk attachment fitted to whisk the whites until they hold firm peaks, standing straight up when you remove the whisk. Using a silicone spatula, gently fold the egg whites into the flour mixture by placing one spoonful of egg whites at a time into the bowl, lifting some of the mixture over the whites and repeating this gently until the whites are completely mixed in and the mixture is light and fluffy. Take great care not to 'crunch' the mixture, pushing out air.	0	mixture dry care time hold place fluffy bowl broken eggs powder mixture whisk beat air apart take milk completely sugar yellow holding peaks mixed 5dd46370c8f1439bb34ba5d1725d1bd0 prying remove shells firm 12 straight baking whisk fold self another letting flour one stir rising 3 spatula light placing large crunch balloon flat teaspoons teaspoon whisk unbroken bowl cups white vanilla again together spoonful use egg pushing slide yolks separate whites extract wet using lifting attachment 34 stand bowl repeating mixer hand silicone standing melted great cracking gently fingers two cup fitted add 1 surface butter flour

how to clarify butter:0	cf45cbaf-c85f-4cee-8695-e2b3e7e564a5	1.    In a small saucepan, melt butter  and cheese over medium-high heat.        2.    Continue to cook over medium-high heat; an even layer of white milk proteins will float to the surface.        3.    Bring to a boil; the milk proteins will become foamy.        4.    Lower heat to medium and continue to gently boil; the milk proteins will break apart.        5.    As the butter gently boils, the milk proteins will eventually sink to the bottom of the pot, and the boiling will begin to calm and then cease. Adjust heat as needed to continue boiling off the water without scorching the milk solids.        6.    Once boiling has stopped, pour butter through a cheesecloth-lined strainer or through a coffee filter into a heatproof container to remove browned milk solids. Let cool, then transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate until ready to use. Clarified butter should keep for at least 6 months in the refrigerator.	1	 foamy cheese remove refrigerate saucepan use transfer least 3 1 solids layer become 6 clarified medium boiling stopped strainer mediumhigh filter scorching refrigerator cook water even gently months cf45cbafc85f4cee8695e2b3e7e564a5 adjust heat without proteins cease calm container cheeseclothlined sink ready bottom milk boils heatproof begin pot bring pour apart cool boil 4 let break needed lower coffee browned 6 surface 5 butter heat small float melt heat eventually 2 sealed keep continue white
